### About  Us

One of the most essential resources for productive ministry is the minister's manual. the fact that so many exist in so many flavors is a testament to ist usefulness to ministster both old and young. As part of our mandate that the Whole Church by the Holy Spirit Take the Whole Gospel to The Whole World, we thought is be prudent that we equip the proclaimers of the Word with a book freely usable, editable, modifyable and distributable.
