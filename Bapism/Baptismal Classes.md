# Baptismal Classes

It is highly advisable, due to the nature of baptism, to first take the candidates through a baptismal class. This is to ensure, for the care of their soul, that they are adequately prepared to recieve the sacrament.

## Incorporating Classes into Congregational Life

When dealing with baptismal classes, there is significant diversity in how they are to be handled. Some elect to  have them as part of membership classes. Others, tend to have separate classes for baptism and membership. Still others dont have classes at all, but counseling sessions with each candidate. There is no set/proscribed way to handle this matter. There is no example of it in scripture. There is, however, evidence of this phenomenon in the early church. [Elaborate]
